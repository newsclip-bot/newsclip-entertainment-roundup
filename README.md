# newsclip-entertainment-roundup

Generate a minimal entertainment roundup output from a page fetch.

A lightweight script designed for simple pipelines.

## Why this exists
- Keep one-off scripts organized instead of scattering snippets across projects.
- Reduce friction when prototyping pipelines and monitoring checks.

## Usage
Example:

## Notes
- For production, you can swap the parsing layer with a robust library.
- Treat output as advisory, not a strict source of truth.
